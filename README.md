# UK House Price Prediction (2015–2024)

This project looks at how house prices have changed across the UK from 2015 to 2024.  
I have cleaned and explored the data, then built a simple Linear Regression model to estimate property prices and understand general price patterns over time.

## Project Overview

The main aim of this project is to study UK house price trends based on property type, county, and year, and to make basic price predictions for the coming years.

### What I did:
1. Data Cleaning – removed duplicates and unrealistic price values  
2. Exploratory Analysis – checked how prices vary by property type, county, and year  
3. Modeling – trained a Linear Regression model to predict house prices  
4. Evaluation – tested the model’s accuracy using RMSE and R² metrics  
5. Prediction Example – the model estimated that a detached house in Greater London (2023) could cost around £462,505

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python for the overall analysis  
- Pandas for data handling and cleaning  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model  
- Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation  

---

## Results Summary
- RMSE: approximately £330,000  
- R² Score: around 0.06 (a basic linear model)  
- Prices showed a steady rise between 2015 and 2022, with a small dip after 2023  
- Greater London and Surrey recorded the highest average property prices

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed features such as property size, number of rooms, or latitude/longitude  
- Experiment with stronger models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting  
- Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI or Tableau to visualize trends
