# UK House Price Prediction (2015–2024)

This project explores how house prices have changed across the UK from 2015 to 2024.  
The aim was to understand general market trends, identify regional variations, and build a simple machine learning model to predict property prices based on key factors such as year, property type, and county.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze UK house price data and make basic predictions for upcoming years.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

### What I Did

1. **Data Cleaning** – removed duplicate entries and unrealistic price values.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – studied how prices varied by property type, county, and year.  
3. **Modeling** – trained a Linear Regression model to estimate house prices.  
4. **Evaluation** – tested the model’s accuracy using RMSE and R² metrics.  
5. **Prediction Example** – the model predicted that a detached house in Greater London (2023) could cost around **£462,505**.

## Results Summary

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** approximately £330,000  
- **R² Score:** around 0.06 (a basic linear model)  
- Prices increased steadily between **2015 and 2022**, followed by a small dip after **2023**.  
- **Greater London** and **Surrey** recorded the highest average property prices.  

These results highlight clear regional differences in housing markets and demonstrate how simple regression models can be used to estimate average price trends.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** – overall analysis and model development  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – for data handling and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for trend visualization and plotting  
- **Scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating the regression model  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for documentation and analysis presentation

## Future Improvements

- Include more detailed property-level features (e.g., number of rooms, size, latitude/longitude).  
- Test stronger algorithms such as **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting**.  
- Develop an interactive **Power BI** or **Tableau dashboard** for visual presentation of trends.  
- Add external economic indicators like inflation or interest rates to improve predictions.  

---

## Key Insights

- UK house prices generally rose from 2015 to 2022 before stabilizing.  
- Detached and semi-detached houses were consistently the most expensive types.  
- Property prices in **Greater London** and **Surrey** were among the highest in the dataset.  
- Although the Linear Regression model is basic, it provides a solid starting point for understanding overall price trends.
